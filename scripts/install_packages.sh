# script to install additional packages for the strategies in this repo

# I find this useful in that I normally have to do this if I upgrade something fundamental like python or anaconda.
# Also, I sometimes get in a mess with package dependencies and have to reset
# Either of these requires me to do a full install of freqtrade (sh setup.sh -r), and then re-install these packages

# Notes:
# - if you need conda versions of packages, you'll need to install those from within the freqtrade venv
# - at the current time, conda packages for the M1 Mac are a mess of conflicting version requirements, so beware
# - the neural network-based strategies require either keras & tensorflow, or darts & pytorch
